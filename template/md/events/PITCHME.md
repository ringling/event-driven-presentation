## Events

`Events drive business, decisions drive value`

Something that has happened, contrary to **commands** which is something you want to happen.<br>
That something could be a state-change e.g. *user-created* or an event *sign-up-email-sent*

A lifecycle can be defined as events, as implemented in finite state machines

* A car was entered as a new inventory (state: “for sale”)
* The car was purchased by a customer  (state: “sold”)
* The car was delivered to a customer (state: “delivered”)
